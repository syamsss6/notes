in 32 bit architecture integer has 4 bytes



*) for a program,initially only a fixed amount of memory Once started running,more is needed.program  request for more memory to the os

in c
------
dynamically allocate memory using : malloc()
deallocating the memory using : free()

if no free() is used,memory leak occurs

languages like python,java,perl,lisp have automatic memory management.

local variable- when function starts,memory is allocated.freed when function ends
global variables -when program starts,memory is allocated,freed when program ends
